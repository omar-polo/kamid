 - compile with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 on linux.
   related: this is needed only for glibc or musl too?

 - (possibly related) find out what pread(2) black magic we can do to
   read stuff on 32 bits

 - rework the ninepscript so tests are parsed and executed by the _kamid
   user and not by root.

 - tweak iounit so it's always lower than the choosen msize

 - handle message bigger than MAX_IMSGSIZE - IMSG_HEADER_SIZE.  One
   way to do that would be to *not* use asynchroonus imsgs in client.c
   but synchronous I/O: this way, once a message has been processed,
   we can just receive the next in the same function (i.e. twrite) and
   go ahead.

 - fill user and group name in struct stat.  The problem is that, being
   chrooted, we don't have access to /etc/passwd nor /etc/group. We
   could use setpassent(3) and setgroupent(3), but if they change in the
   meantime we can't do anything.  Another solution would be to not
   to chroot(2) and just switch to the targeted user.
