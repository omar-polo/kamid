 - compile with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 on linux.
   related: this is needed only for glibc or musl too?

 - (possibly related) find out what pread(2) black magic we can do to
   read stuff on 32 bits

 - rework the ninepscript so tests are parsed and executed by the _kamid
   user and not by root.

 - tweak iounit so it's always lower than the choosen msize

 - handle message bigger than MAX_IMSGSIZE - IMSG_HEADER_SIZE.  One
   way to do that would be to *not* use asynchroonus imsgs in client.c
   but synchronous I/O: this way, once a message has been processed,
   we can just receive the next in the same function (i.e. twrite) and
   go ahead.
