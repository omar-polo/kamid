.Sh NAME
.Nm 9P
.Nd Simple Distributed File System
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a protocol that implements a distributed file systems.
It provides primitives to manage
.Pq create, read, write and delete
sets of files remotely.
These files don't necessarily need to be actually stored on a disk,
they may be, for example, synthesise on demand from external sources.
.Pp
A client transmits requests
.Pq T-messages
to a server, which returns replies
.Pq R-messages
to the client.
The combined acts of transmitting a request of a particular type and
receiving a reply is called a transaction of that type.
.Pp
Each message consists of a sequence of bytes mostly grouped in one,
two or four integer fields transmitted in little-endian order
.Pq least significant byte first .
Data items of larger or variable lengths are represented by a two-byte
field specifying the length followed by the actual data.
The only exception to this rule are QIDs, thirteen byte long
objects, that are sent as-is.
.Pp
Text strings are represented with a two-byte count and the sequence of
UNICODE codepoints encoded in UTF-8.
Text strings in 9p are not NUL-terminated.
The NUL-terminator is illegal in all text strings and thus excluded
from paths, user names and so on.
.Pp
Fields are hereafter denoted as
.Bd -literal -offset indent
type[1] tag[2] fid[4]
.Ed
.Pp
to indicate that type is one byte long, tag two and fid four.
Strings are denoted as name[s] and are sent on the wire as
.Bd -literal -offset indent
length[2] string[length]
.Ed
.Pp
A qid, described later, is a 13-byte value that is sent on the wire as
.Bd -literal -offset indent
type[1] version[4] path[8]
.Ed
.Sh MESSAGE STRUCTURE
Every message has a header with the following fields:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
len[4] type[1] tag[2]
.Ed
.Pp
where len indicates the overall length of the message, including
itself; type is one byte indicating the type of the message and the
tag is a number choosen by the client that indicate uniquely the
request.
Then follows an optional body whose structure depends on the type of
the message.
.Pp
The message types are as follows:
.Pq the header is omitted for brevity
.Bl -tag -width versionxx
.It Ic version
Negotiate the version and maximum message size.
.Bd -literal
msize[4] version[s]
msize[4] version[s]
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ic version
request must be the first message sent, and the client cannot issue
further requests until receiving the Rversion reply.
.Cm tag
should be
.Dv NOTAG
.Pq \-1 or 255 .
The client suggest a
.Cm msize
.Pq the maximum size for packets
and the protocol version used, the server replies with a
.Cm msize
smaller or equal to the one proposed by the client.
The version string must always begin with the two character
.Dq 9P .
If the server don't understand the client required version, should
reply with a Rversion using the version string
.Dq unknown
and not use a Rerror.
.It Ic attach
Populate the namespace
.Bd -literal
fid[4] afid[4] uname[s] aname[s]
qid[13]
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ic attach
message binds the given
.Ar fid
to the root of the file tree identified by
.Ar aname .
.Ar uname
identifies the user and
.Ar afid
specifies a fid previously established by an auth message, or the
special
.Dv NOFID 
value
.Pq defined as (u32int)~0
if the authentication is not required.
.It Ic clunk
Close fids.
.Bd -literal
fid[4]
.Aq empty response
.Ed
.Pp
Once a fid has been clunked
.Pq closed
it becomes
.Dq free
and the same value can be used for subsequential
.Ic walk
or
.Ic attach
requests.
.Pp
The actual file on the disk is not remove unless it was opened with the
.Dv ORCLOSE
flag.
.It Ic error
Return an error string.
.Bd -literal
ename[s]
.Ed
.Pp
The Rerror message is used to return an error string describing the
failure of a request.
The
.Cm tag
indicates the failed request.
.Pp
Note that there isn't a
.Ic Terror
request for obvious reason and it's not possible for a server to reply to
a
.Ic Tversion
or
.Ic Tflush
using
.Ic Rerror .
.It Ic flush
Abort an ongoing operation.
.Bd -literal
oldtag[2]
.Aq empty response
.Ed
.Pp
Given the asynchronous nature of the protocol, the server may respond to
the pending request before responding to the
.Ic Tflush
and is possible for a client to send multiple
.Ic Tflush
for the same operation.
The client must wait to receive a corresponding
.Ic Rflush
before reusing
.Ar oldtag
for subsequent messages.
.Pp
If a response for
.Ar oldtag
is received before the
.Ic Rflush
reply, the client must assume that the operation was completed with success
.Pq fid allocated, files created, ...
If no response is received before the
.Ic Rflush
then the transaction is considered to have been successfully cancelled.
.Pp
Note that the tag of this request and the corresponding reply is NOT
.Ar oldtag
but a new tag value.
.It Ic walk
Traverse a file tree.
.Bd -literal
fid[4] newfid[4] nwname[2] nwname*(wname[s])
nwqid[2] nwqid*(qid[13])
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ar nwname
components are walked in order starting from
.Ar fid
.Pq which must point to a directory
and, if successful,
.Ar newfid
is associated to the reached file.
.Pp
It is possible for
.Ar fid
and
.Ar newfid
to be equal, in this case the fid is
.Dq mutated ,
otherwise
.Ar newfid
must be unused.
As a special case, a walk of zero components duplicates the fid.
.Pp
If the first element cannot be walked for any reason an
.Ic Rerror
is returned.
Otherwise,
.Ic Rwalk
is returned with a number of qids equal to the file viside by the walk.
A client can thus detect a walk when that the replied
.Ar nwqid
number is not equal to the
.Ar nwname
field in the request.
Only when walk return successfully
.Ar newfid
will be affected.
.Pp
A maximum of 16 component can be used per walk request.
.It Ic open
Prepare a fid for I/O.
.Bd -literal
fid[4] mode[1]
qid[13] iounit[4]
.Ed
.Pp
.Ar mode
determines the type of I/O:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It 0 Dt OREAD
.It 1 Dt OWRITE
.It 2 Dt ORDWD
.It 3 Dt OEXEC
.El
.Pp
The returned
.Ar iounit
is the optimal blocksize for I/O.
